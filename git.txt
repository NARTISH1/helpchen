How to install git on a local machine

Step 1:
Download the latest version of Git and choose the 64/32 bit version. After the file is downloaded, install it in the system. Once installed, select Launch the Git Bash, then click on finish. The Git Bash is now launched.

Git Installation

Step 2:
Check the Git version:

$ git --version
Step 3:
For any help, use the following command:

$ git help config
This command will lead you to a browser of config commands. Basically, the help command provides a manual from the help page for the command just following it (here, it's config).

Another way to use the same command is as follows:

$ git config --help
Step 4:
Create a local directory using the following command:

$ mkdir test

$ cd test

Step 5:
The next step is to initialize the directory:

$ git init
Step 6:
Go to the folder where "test" is created and create a text document named "demo." Open "demo" and put any content, like "Hello Simplilearn." Save and close the file.

Step 7:
Enter the Git bash interface and type in the following command to check the status:

$ git status
Step 8:
Add the "demo" to the current directory using the following command:

$ git add demo.txt
Step 9:
Next, make a commit using the following command:

$ git commit -m "committing a text file"
Step 10:
Link the Git to a Github Account:

$ git config --global user.username

Step 11:
Open your Github account and create a new repository with the name "test_demo" and click on "Create repository." This is the remote repository. Next, copy the link of "test_demo."

Step 12:
Go back to Git bash and link the remote and local repository using the following command:

$ git remote add origin <link>
Here, <link> is the link copied in the previous step.
Step 13:
Push the local file onto the remote repository using the following command:

$ git push origin master
Step 14:
Move back to Github and click on "test_demo" and check if the local file "demo.txt" is pushed to this repository.
